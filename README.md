# kburns-slideshow
kburns-slideshow allows the creation of video slideshows from images with kburns (zoom/pan) effect, videos with and without sound and background music.

The project is based on [the python implementation](https://github.com/Trekky12/kburns) of [kburns by remko](https://github.com/remko/kburns) and [kburns2 by sargue](https://github.com/sargue/kburns).
